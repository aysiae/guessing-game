        <p>I am Tahmina, I grew up in a small town in Montana in the foot hills of the Beartooth Mountains. I love all things flowers and nature. Five years ago, I started my own floral and event design company in order to be able to care for my now five year old twins, while simultaneously, providing an income for our family. My goals are to create a healthy work life balance as well as continuously learn, challenge myself and make an impact. My intention is to complete the Code Fellows program and enter into the tech industry doing something that fills my soul and challenges me daily.</p>
